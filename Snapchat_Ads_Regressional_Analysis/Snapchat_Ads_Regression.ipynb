    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "- Prediction Problem: **Regression problem to predict Impressions**. \n",
    "- Features that will be used to predict Impressions would be: 'Currency Code', 'Spend', 'Impressions', 'StartDate','EndDate', 'Gender', 'AgeBracket', 'CountryCode', 'Interests', and 'Language'\n",
    "- The objective of the project is to increase accuracy measured by the R^2 score of the model.\n",
    "- Since it is not a classification problem, we can ignore the Sensitivity and Specificity aspects of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "- Features\n",
    "    - Quantitative: Spend\n",
    "    - Ordinal: *None*\n",
    "    - Nominal: CurrencyCode, CountryCode\n",
    "- Notice how there are no ordinal features, for the baseline model.\n",
    "- A lot of the initial features are taken away as they need to be engineered in order to be useful.\n",
    "- Nominal Features will be one-hot encoded.\n",
    "- **The R^2 score of the baseline model floats around 0.3 and 0.6 for the most part.**\n",
    "- I think that the score value looks promising. It looks like most of the regression is done based on Spend, which makes sense since higher spending on the ad correlates directly with impressions observed.\n",
    "- However, I think that the model can be improved by engineering additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "- Engineered Features:\n",
    "    - MultiLabelBinarizer for OHE of Interests and Language: targeted interests of ads might play a role on the impressions it gets. Perhaps certain interests are taken more seriously for some viewers.\n",
    "    - Duration derived from StartDate and EndDate. There should be a direct correlation between duration of the ads airtime and its impressions.\n",
    "- Findings:\n",
    "    - GridSearch on best parameter for categorical features PCA n_components (Currency Code, CountryCode, Interests, Language)\n",
    "    - Discovered that all the categorical features are advised to be taken out.\n",
    "    - Essentially back to baseline model but added imputation strategy for quantitative columns\n",
    "    - Slight imporvement in R^2 score, better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "- Compared the accuracy of the model for year 2019 and 2020.\n",
    "- It seems to be doing better for the year 2019 than 2020 by quite a margin. \n",
    "- The mean R^2 value for the 2020 model is negative. \n",
    "- One reason to explain this is probably the fact that 2020 is still the current year so there is not sufficient data to model it. \n",
    "- Whereas 2019 data make up for most of the main dataset which created the model so it results in a higher accuracy.\n"

    "One interesting observation here is the difference in how the model predicted impressions for data on 2019 and 2020. It seems to be doing better for the year 2019 than 2020 by quite a margin. The mean R^2 value for the 2020 model is negative. One reason to explain this is probably the fact that 2020 is still the current year so there is not sufficient data to model it. Whereas 2019 data make up for most of the main dataset which created the model so it results in a higher accuracy."
